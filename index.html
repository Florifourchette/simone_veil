    <h2>Her Story</h2>
    <h3>Before the war</h3>
    <p>Simone Jacob was born in Nice in south-east France on 13 July 1927, in an atheist Jewish family. Her father André Jacob was an architect who graduated from the Beaux-Arts de Paris and went on to win the Prix de Rome for Architecture.[4] In 1922 he married Yvonne Steinmetz, who had just passed her Baccalaureate and was about to start studying chemistry. André Jacob insisted that she abandon her studies upon marriage.[5] The family moved from Paris to Nice in 1924, hoping to benefit from construction projects on the Côte d’Azur.[5] Simone was the youngest of four siblings, Madeleine (nicknamed Milou) was born in 1923; Denise in 1924 and Jean in 1925.[6] On her father’s side, the family had come from Lorraine, on her mother’s from the Rhineland region and from Belgium.[7]
        <br>Simone's family was explicitly Jewish but non-practicing.[8]. "Being a member of the Jewish community was never a problem. It was proudly claimed by my father, but for cultural reasons, not religious ones," she wrote in her autobiography. "In his eyes, if the Jewish people were to remain the chosen people, it was because they were the people of the Book, the people of thinking and writing.

        <h3>During the war</h3>
    <p>
    <br>When Germany invaded France and the Vichy regime came to power in June 1940, the family managed to avoid being deported, as Nice had been included in the Italian occupation zone.[10] Asked not to come to school by its superintendent, Simone Jacob had to study at home. As the round-up of Jews intensified, the whole family split up and lived with different friends under false identities. Denise left for Lyon to join the resistance, while 16-year-old Simone kept studying and passed her baccalaureate exam under her real name in March 1944.[11] The next day, as she was on her way out to meet friends and celebrate the end of her secondary education, she was arrested by the Gestapo.[11] On the same day, the rest of the family was also rounded up.

    <br>On 7 April 1944, Simone, her mother, and her sisters were sent to the transit camp of Drancy, then on 13 April were deported to Auschwitz in Convoy 71.[4] Simone’s brother and father were deported to the Baltic states in Convoy 73, never to be seen again, and thus were assumed to have been murdered. Her sister Denise was deported to Ravensbrück concentration camp, which she survived, and after the end of World War II in Europe was reunited with Simone.

    <br>On 15 April 1944, Simone Jacob arrived at Auschwitz. She later wrote that she managed to avoid the gas chamber by lying about her age and was registered for the labour camp.[12] In January 1945, Simone, along with her mother and sister, was sent on a march to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where her mother died of typhus. Madeleine also fell ill but, like Simone, was saved when the camp was liberated on 15 April 1945.

    <h3>After the war</h3>
    <p>Simone Jacob returned to France and started studying law at the University of Paris before going to the Institut d'études politiques, where she met Antoine Veil.[14] The couple married on 26 October 1946, and would go on to have three sons, Jean, Nicolas, and Pierre-François. They moved to Germany, where they lived in the American occupied zone.[15] In 1952, Madeleine Jacob died with her son in a car accident, after visiting Simone in Stuttgart.[16] In 1956, Simone gave up working as a lawyer and instead passed the national examination to become a magistrate. And had a huge political career - go check <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Veil" target="_blank">WIKIPEDIA</a> for more info.

        <h3>After her death</h3>
    <p>In 2018, the government of France established a prize in memory of Veil to honour people who fight for women's causes. The intent is to draw attention to efforts in promoting women's autonomy, education, participation in leadership roles, and freedom from violence and discrimination.[43] The prize is awarded each year on 8 March, International Women's Day, with €100,000 to support work in the winner's area of concern. On 8 March 2019, the first Simone Veil Prize was awarded to Aissa Doumara Ngatansou, co-founder of the Association for the Elimination of Violence against Women (ALVF) in Cameroon.
